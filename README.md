# pNumericBases
A processing sketch used to demonstrate how numeric bases work

I've wrote it to use in my "Introduction to software development with Pure Data" course, realized in Instituto de Artes da Unesp in 2017.

## How to run

You can either:

* Download the source files from the ["releases" page](https://github.com/HenriAugusto/pSamplingTheorem/releases) then open the .pde in Processing](https://processing.org/) then click "run"
* Download the binary files for windows from the ["releases" page](https://github.com/HenriAugusto/pSamplingTheorem/releases) then extract the .rar and run it.

Just type in the base and some nubmers to see how the value is constructed
